COMP 559 - Winter 2021 - Assignment 1

Numerical Integration of Particle Systems

## Mouse spring interaction
* Can test it with default test system 1.

## Particles with mass
* Particles can have different mass - set this in the option panel before creating the particle.
* The size of the particle is proportional to the mass, they all have the same density.

## Particles with colour
* The colour of particles depends on the velocity and direction in which they are moving.

## Interesting Movie
* I have saved an interesting spider-like creature with restitution and colourful particles with different mass.

## Save and load
* The buttons are implemented in the options and uses xlsx files which has the advantage of being human editable.
